# Scroll-Triggered Fade-In Animations

## Overview
Added smooth fade-in animations to all procedure pages that trigger as users scroll through the content. This creates a more engaging and polished user experience.

## What Was Added

### 1. CSS Animations (`css/styles.css`)
- **`.fade-in-element`** - Base hidden state for elements
- **`.fade-in-visible`** - Visible state triggered when scrolling
- **`.fade-in-left`** - Slide in from left variant
- **`.fade-in-right`** - Slide in from right variant
- **`.fade-in-fast`** - Faster 0.5s animation
- **`.fade-in-slow`** - Slower 1.2s animation
- Staggered delays for child elements (0.1s - 0.8s)

### 2. JavaScript (`js/main.js`)
- New `initScrollFadeIn()` function
- Uses IntersectionObserver API for performance
- Triggers 100px before element enters viewport
- Added to main initialization on page load

### 3. HTML Updates (All 51 Procedure Pages)
Applied `fade-in-element` class to:
- Quick info bars
- Procedure sections
- Process steps
- Benefit cards
- Info boxes & warning boxes
- Recovery phases
- Candidate boxes
- Timeline boxes
- FAQ items
- CTA sections

## Pages Updated
All 51 procedure pages in `/pages/procedures/`:
- Body procedures (7)
- Facial procedures (6)
- Hair procedures (2)
- Pelvic/Intimate procedures (10)
- Pelvic/Reproductive procedures (8)
- Sexual Health procedures (9)
- Wellness procedures (9)

## How to Test
1. Open any procedure page: `http://localhost:8000/pages/procedures/body/liposuction-360.html`
2. Scroll down the page
3. Watch as sections smoothly fade in from below as they enter the viewport

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- IntersectionObserver has 95%+ browser support
- Graceful degradation: elements still appear if JavaScript is disabled

## Performance
- IntersectionObserver is very efficient (no scroll event listeners)
- Minimal CPU usage
- Elements transition using CSS transforms (GPU accelerated)

## Customization
To adjust animation speed or distance, edit `css/styles.css`:
```css
.fade-in-element {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(30px); /* Change distance */
  transition: opacity 0.8s ease-out, transform 0.8s ease-out; /* Change speed */
}
```

## Files Modified
- `css/styles.css` - Added animation CSS
- `js/main.js` - Added IntersectionObserver logic
- All 51 procedure HTML files - Added fade-in classes
- `add-fade-animations.sh` - Automation script (can be deleted if not needed)

## Next Steps
Consider adding fade-in animations to:
- Main category pages (body-procedures.html, facial-procedures.html, etc.)
- Homepage sections
- Contact page sections
