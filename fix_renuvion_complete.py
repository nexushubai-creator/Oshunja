                        <p>Meet with our fellowship-trained surgeon to discuss your concerns, medical history, and desired outcomes. We'll map your torso individually, considering posture and body shape.</p>

                        <p>Marked zones are numbed with tumescent anaesthetic that also constricts blood vessels. Micro-cannulas remove fat circumferentially around the torso to sculpt an hourglass or V-taper. Fat is feathered into adjacent zones for smooth transitions.</p>

                        <p>You are placed in a custom compression garment and escorted to a private recovery lounge. Follow-up visits monitor progress at key healing milestones.</p>

                        <p>Meet with our Kingston surgeon to evaluate your skin laxity, discuss treatment areas, and set realistic expectations. We'll assess skin quality, determine if you're a good candidate, and create your personalized Renuvion treatment plan.</p>

                        <p>Tiny incisions (3-5mm) are made in discreet locations. The Renuvion handpiece is inserted beneath the skin, delivering controlled helium plasma and RF energy. This heats subdermal tissue to precise temperatures, causing immediate collagen contraction. Multiple passes ensure uniform tightening across treatment zones.</p>

                        <p>Incisions are closed with tiny sutures or skin glue. Compression garments are applied to treated areas. You rest in recovery for 1-2 hours before being discharged home the same day with detailed aftercare instructions.</p>
