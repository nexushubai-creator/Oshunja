                            <p>Your first session (60-90 minutes) is a comprehensive evaluation of your current health status, lifestyle, goals, challenges, and motivation. We explore your health history, typical daily routines, eating patterns, physical activity, sleep quality, stress levels, previous attempts at change, and what's worked or failed before. This deep understanding allows us to create a truly personalized coaching plan—not generic advice.</p>

                            <p>Together we establish clear, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Instead of vague aspirations like "be healthier," we define concrete targets: lose 15 pounds in 3 months, reduce A1C from 6.8 to 6.2, walk 10,000 steps daily, sleep 7+ hours nightly. We also explore your deeper "why"—the emotional drivers that will sustain you when motivation wanes.</p>

                            <p>Based on your assessment and goals, we create a customized action plan addressing nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, and mindset. Plans start with 1-3 small, manageable changes to build momentum and confidence. We don't overwhelm you with dramatic life overhauls—we focus on sustainable habits that compound over time.</p>

Sessions include progress review, celebrating wins, identifying obstacles, problem-solving challenges, adjusting strategies, learning new skills (meal prep, stress reduction techniques, exercise form), and planning for upcoming challenges (travel, holidays, stressful periods).</p>

                            <p>Between sessions, track relevant metrics: weight, body measurements, food logs, activity levels, sleep hours, energy ratings, mood, or symptoms. Your coach reviews this data to identify patterns, celebrate consistency, and spot areas needing adjustment. Accountability isn't about judgment—it's about awareness and support. Knowing someone is checking in dramatically improves adherence.</p>

                        <p>Most clients meet with their coach <strong>weekly or bi-weekly</strong> (every 2 weeks) for optimal accountability and support. Initial phases typically benefit from weekly sessions to establish momentum and address early challenges. As habits solidify and you gain confidence (usually after 8-12 weeks), many clients transition to bi-weekly or monthly check-ins. Session frequency is customized based on your goals, progress, and preferences.</p>

                        <summary>How long does wellness coaching last?</summary>
                        <p>Most clients engage in coaching for <strong>3-6 months</strong> initially to establish sustainable habits and achieve primary goals. Some see significant results in 12 weeks; others benefit from 6-12 months of support for more complex goals or chronic condition management. After the intensive phase, many clients continue with monthly or quarterly maintenance sessions. There's no rigid timeline—coaching duration is flexible based on your needs and progress.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What's the difference between wellness coaching and therapy/counseling?</summary>
                        <p>Wellness coaches focus on <strong>present and future</strong>—setting goals, building skills, implementing strategies, and creating accountability for health behavior change. Coaches don't diagnose or treat mental health conditions. Therapists/counselors focus on mental health treatment, past trauma, emotional processing, and clinical conditions like depression or anxiety. Many people benefit from BOTH—coaching for health behaviors and therapy for mental health. We can coordinate with your therapist if you're receiving both services.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Will insurance cover wellness coaching?</summary>
                        <p>Coverage varies significantly. Some insurance plans cover wellness coaching or "health coaching" as a preventive service, especially when related to chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension, obesity). However, many plans do not cover coaching. We recommend checking with your insurance provider about coverage for health coaching or lifestyle medicine services. We can provide documentation and codes to support reimbursement claims. Self-pay options are available.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What happens if I miss sessions or fall off track?</summary>
                        <p>Life happens—we understand! Missing sessions or having setbacks doesn't mean failure; it's part of the process. Your coach will help you get back on track without judgment, identify what caused the lapse, problem-solve obstacles, and adjust strategies as needed. Coaching teaches you how to recover from setbacks rather than letting them derail all progress. The key is re-engaging rather than quitting entirely.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Do I need to track my food/activity/habits?</summary>
                        <p>Tracking depends on your goals and what works for your personality. Many clients benefit from tracking initially (food logs, step counts, sleep hours, weight) to establish awareness and identify patterns. Tracking provides objective data for your coach to review. However, if tracking feels overwhelming or triggering, we'll find alternative monitoring methods. The goal is accountability—not obsessive tracking. We tailor monitoring strategies to your preferences.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Can coaching help if I've failed at diets/programs before?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely—that's exactly <strong>why</strong> coaching is effective! Previous "failures" usually aren't about willpower or lack of discipline. They're about unsustainable approaches, unaddressed barriers (stress, emotional eating, poor sleep), lack of support, or plans that didn't fit your life. Coaching identifies WHY past attempts failed, addresses root causes, provides accountability, and creates realistic strategies you can actually maintain. Our approach is completely different from restrictive diet programs.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What credentials do your wellness coaches have?</summary>
                        <p>Our wellness coaches hold professional certifications from recognized organizations such as the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching (NBC-HWC), American Council on Exercise (ACE), National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), or similar credentialing bodies. They're trained in behavior change psychology, motivational interviewing, lifestyle medicine, health promotion, and chronic disease management. They work collaboratively with our medical team for integrated care.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Can my family or partner be involved in coaching?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! Family involvement can be extremely beneficial, especially when household members affect your environment, meal planning, or motivation. We can include your partner or family members in select sessions, provide family-focused strategies, or offer couple's wellness coaching. Having a supportive home environment dramatically improves success rates. We'll discuss how family involvement fits your situation.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>How is wellness coaching different from working with a personal trainer?</summary>
                        <p>Personal trainers focus primarily on <strong>exercise</strong>—designing workouts, teaching proper form, and providing accountability for fitness. Wellness coaches take a <strong>holistic approach</strong> addressing nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, habit change, and mindset across all areas of health. If your primary goal is fitness programming, a trainer is ideal. If you need comprehensive lifestyle change support beyond just exercise, wellness coaching is more appropriate. Some clients work with both!</p>
