                            <p>Your first session (60-90 minutes) is a comprehensive evaluation. We review your medical history, current medications, lab results, health goals, dietary preferences, cultural food traditions, typical eating patterns, cooking abilities, budget constraints, and lifestyle factors. This deep dive allows us to understand YOUR unique situation—not just a general nutrition profile.</p>

                            <p>We may ask you to track your food intake, eating times, portion sizes, hunger/fullness levels, and any symptoms for 3-7 days. This real-world data reveals patterns, triggers, nutrient gaps, and opportunities for improvement that aren't obvious in a single consultation.</p>

Plans incorporate foods you actually enjoy (including traditional Jamaican dishes), fit your schedule, and address your medical needs. No restrictive diets that you can't sustain—just practical eating strategies designed for long-term success.</p>

                            <p>Nutrition counseling works best with ongoing support. Follow-up sessions (typically 30-45 minutes) allow us to review your progress, troubleshoot challenges, celebrate successes, adjust meal plans as needed, review lab work improvements, and ensure you're staying on track. Accountability matters—regular check-ins dramatically improve long-term adherence.</p>

If you're managing diabetes, we coordinate with your doctor regarding blood sugar goals and medication adjustments.

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Do I need a referral to see the dietitian?</summary>
                        <p>No referral is required—you can book nutrition counseling directly with us. However, if you plan to use insurance coverage for nutrition services, your insurance company may require a physician referral for reimbursement. We can help coordinate this with your doctor's office if needed. Self-pay is always an option regardless of referral status.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>How many sessions will I need?</summary>
                        <p>This varies based on your goals and complexity of your situation. Most patients benefit from an <strong>initial consultation (60-90 minutes)</strong> plus <strong>3-6 follow-up sessions (30-45 minutes each)</strong> over 3-6 months to establish sustainable habits. Chronic disease management may require more frequent visits initially. Once you've achieved your goals, quarterly maintenance visits help ensure long-term success and address new challenges as they arise.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Can you accommodate cultural or religious dietary restrictions?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely! We specialize in creating nutrition plans that honor your cultural traditions, religious dietary laws (halal, kosher, vegetarian, etc.), and food preferences. We're experienced with Caribbean cuisine including traditional Jamaican foods and cooking methods. Our goal is to help you meet your health goals while eating foods you actually enjoy and that fit your cultural identity—not forcing you to adopt unfamiliar "Western health foods."</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Will I have to give up foods I love?</summary>
                        <p>No! We don't believe in extreme elimination or "never eat this" restrictions. Our approach focuses on <strong>balance, moderation, and smart modifications</strong>. We'll show you how to enjoy your favorite foods in appropriate portions, how to make healthier versions of traditional dishes, and how to fit treats into an overall healthy eating pattern. Food is meant to be enjoyed—not feared. Sustainable nutrition plans include flexibility for real life.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Do you provide actual meal plans with recipes?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! You'll receive personalized meal plans with specific recipes, portion sizes, meal timing, and preparation instructions. Plans include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options tailored to your schedule, cooking skills, budget, family size, and nutritional needs. We can provide options for meal prep strategies, quick weeknight meals, batch cooking, and eating out. Recipes incorporate foods you enjoy and are appropriate for your medical conditions.</p>

                        <summary>Will insurance cover nutrition counseling?</summary>
                        <p>Coverage varies significantly by insurance provider and plan. Many insurance plans cover "Medical Nutrition Therapy" (MNT) for certain conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or obesity—often requiring a physician referral and diagnosis codes. Preventive nutrition counseling may not be covered. We recommend contacting your insurance company to verify your specific benefits. We can provide documentation and codes to support your claim. Self-pay options are available if insurance doesn't cover services.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What's the difference between a dietitian and a nutritionist?</summary>
                        <p>A <strong>Registered Dietitian (RD)</strong> or <strong>Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN)</strong> has completed extensive education (bachelor's or master's degree in nutrition), supervised clinical practice, passed a national examination, and maintains continuing education requirements. Dietitians can provide Medical Nutrition Therapy for disease management. "Nutritionist" is not a protected title in many places and may not require formal credentials. At OSHUNJA, you'll work with a credentialed registered dietitian providing evidence-based medical nutrition therapy.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Can nutrition counseling help if I've failed at diets before?</summary>
                        <p>Yes—in fact, that's exactly why medical nutrition counseling is different and more effective than commercial diets. Past "failures" usually aren't about lack of willpower—they're about unsustainable approaches, unaddressed underlying issues (insulin resistance, thyroid problems, nutrient deficiencies), or plans that don't fit your life. We identify WHY previous attempts didn't work, address root causes, and create realistic strategies you can actually maintain long-term. Our approach is about sustainable behavior change, not short-term deprivation.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Do I need to track everything I eat?</summary>
                        <p>Not necessarily for the long term. We may ask you to track food intake for a week or two initially to establish baseline data and identify patterns. Some patients find tracking helpful for accountability, while others find it stressful. We'll work with you to find monitoring strategies that work for YOUR personality and situation—whether that's detailed tracking, portion awareness, hunger/fullness cues, or weekly weigh-ins. The goal is sustainable habits, not permanent food logging.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What if I don't know how to cook or have limited time?</summary>
                        <p>That's completely fine—many of our patients have limited cooking skills or busy schedules. We'll meet you where you are and provide strategies that fit your situation: simple 15-20 minute meals, slow cooker recipes, meal prep shortcuts, healthy convenience foods, assembly meals requiring no cooking, and restaurant ordering guides. You don't need to become a gourmet chef to eat healthily. We'll teach basic skills gradually if you're interested, or work within your current capabilities if not.</p>
