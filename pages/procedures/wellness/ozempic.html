                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Ozempic (semaglutide) is a once-weekly injectable medication that has transformed weight management for patients in Kingston, Jamaica. Originally developed for type 2 diabetes, this GLP-1 receptor agonist works by mimicking the body's natural hunger-regulating hormones, reducing appetite and promoting significant, sustainable weight loss when combined with lifestyle modifications.</p>
                <p>At OSHUNJA, we offer medically supervised Ozempic treatment as part of a comprehensive weight management program. Our Kingston-based team provides thorough evaluation, personalized dosing, nutritional guidance, and ongoing monitoring to maximize your results while minimizing side effects. Unlike quick-fix diets, Ozempic addresses the biological mechanisms that make weight loss difficult, helping you achieve long-term success.</p>
                <p>Clinical studies demonstrate that patients typically lose 12-15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. Beyond weight loss, many patients experience improved energy, better blood sugar control, reduced cardiovascular risk, and enhanced confidence. Our holistic approach ensures you receive the support, education, and medical oversight necessary for a safe and successful transformation journey.</p>

                        <h3>Comprehensive Medical Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Your journey begins with a thorough consultation at our Kingston clinic. We review your complete medical history, weight loss history, current medications, family history of thyroid cancer, and any history of pancreatitis or gastroparesis. We discuss your weight loss goals, lifestyle, eating habits, and assess whether Ozempic is medically appropriate and safe for you. This ensures we screen for contraindications before prescribing.</p>

                        <h3>Baseline Testing & Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Complete laboratory workup including fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C (for diabetes screening), kidney function (creatinine, eGFR), liver enzymes, and thyroid function. We document your starting weight, body measurements, BMI, and take progress photos if desired. These baselines allow us to track your metabolic improvements and ensure safe medication use throughout treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Prescription & Injection Training</h3>
                        <p>Receive your Ozempic prescription and pre-filled pen injector. Our Kingston medical team provides hands-on training: how to prepare the pen, select injection sites (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm), proper injection technique, safe disposal of needles, and storage requirements (refrigerate until first use). Most patients feel confident after one demonstration—the pen is designed to be simple and nearly painless.</p>

                        <h3>Start Low: Initial Dose (0.25mg)</h3>
                        <p>Begin with the lowest starter dose of <strong>0.25mg once weekly for 4 weeks</strong>. This gradual introduction allows your body to adjust to the medication and minimizes side effects like nausea. During this phase, you'll likely notice reduced appetite and some early weight loss (2-5 pounds typically). We provide strategies for managing any digestive side effects.</p>

                        <h3>Dose Titration (0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg)</h3>
                        <p>Every 4 weeks, we increase your dose as tolerated: 0.25mg → 0.5mg → 1mg → 2mg (maximum). Dose escalation is gradual to minimize side effects while maximizing weight loss efficacy. Regular check-ins (in-person or virtual) allow us to monitor your progress, assess tolerance, adjust dosing if needed, and provide ongoing support.

                        <p>Throughout treatment, work with our dietitian and wellness coach to develop sustainable eating habits, increase physical activity, manage stress, and improve sleep. Ozempic reduces appetite and cravings, but you still need to make healthy food choices and stay active. We provide meal planning guidance, exercise recommendations, and behavioral strategies to maximize your results and prepare for long-term maintenance.</p>

Once you reach your goal weight or therapeutic dose, transition to maintenance phase. Most patients continue Ozempic long-term to sustain weight loss, as stopping often leads to weight regain. We develop a sustainable maintenance strategy tailored to your goals and budget.</p>

                            <li>You've tried traditional diets and exercise but haven't achieved lasting results—your body's hunger hormones keep working against you</li>

                            <li>You're ready to make this a lifestyle shift, not just another quick fix—combining medication with better nutrition and movement habits</li>
                            <li>You want medical expertise guiding your weight loss journey rather than navigating it alone</li>
                            <li>You're comfortable with weekly self-injections (we teach you—it's easier than you think!)</li>
                            <li>You understand that sustainable weight loss takes time—typically 1-2 pounds per week, with patience rewarded by lasting transformation</li>

                            <li><strong>Thyroid Cancer History:</strong> Ozempic isn't appropriate if you or close family members have had medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2</li>
                            <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> If you have a history of severe pancreatitis or gastroparesis, we'll need to carefully evaluate whether Ozempic is safe for you</li>
                            <li><strong>Managing Side Effects:</strong> Most patients experience some nausea, especially early on. It usually improves, but you need to be prepared for temporary digestive adjustments</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Commitment:</strong> Ozempic is an ongoing investment—monthly costs range significantly depending on insurance. We'll discuss affordability upfront</li>
                            <li><strong>Long-term Perspective:</strong> This isn't a short-term solution. Many patients regain weight after stopping, so plan for sustained treatment to maintain results</li>

                        <summary>How much weight can I expect to lose on Ozempic?</summary>
                        <p>Clinical studies show patients lose an average of <strong>12-15% of their starting body weight over 68 weeks</strong> (about 16 months) when combined with lifestyle changes. For someone starting at 200 pounds, that's 24-30 pounds. Individual results vary significantly based on starting weight, dose achieved, adherence to treatment, diet quality, exercise habits, sleep, and stress management. Some lose more, some less. Typical weight loss is <strong>1-2 pounds per week</strong> in the initial months, slowing as you approach your goal weight.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>What are the common side effects and how can I manage them?</summary>
                        <p>Most common side effects are gastrointestinal: <strong>nausea (20-30% of patients), vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and stomach discomfort</strong>. These typically occur when starting treatment or increasing dose, and usually decrease after 4-8 weeks as your body adjusts. <strong>Management strategies:</strong> Eat smaller, more frequent meals; avoid greasy, fatty, or spicy foods; stay hydrated; eat slowly; try ginger tea for nausea; take medication with food if nausea is severe. Most side effects are temporary and manageable. If severe or persistent, we can slow dose titration or provide anti-nausea medication.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Do I have to inject myself weekly?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, Ozempic is self-administered via <strong>once-weekly subcutaneous injection</strong>. However, the pre-filled pen device is designed to be extremely simple and nearly painless—much easier than most people anticipate. The needle is very small (similar to insulin pens), and you inject into fatty tissue (abdomen, thigh, or upper arm) where there are few nerve endings. We provide thorough hands-on training at our Kingston clinic, and most patients become comfortable with injections after the first 1-2 weeks. Many describe it as easier than a mosquito bite.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>How long do I need to stay on Ozempic to maintain weight loss?</summary>
                        <p>Ozempic is typically a <strong>long-term or lifelong treatment</strong>. Research shows that most patients regain 50-70% of lost weight within one year of stopping the medication because the underlying biological mechanisms driving weight regain (hunger hormones, metabolic adaptation) return. For sustained weight loss, continued use is usually recommended. Some patients maintain results with lower maintenance doses or transition to lifestyle-only management, but this requires exceptional adherence to diet and exercise. We'll work with you to develop a realistic, sustainable plan.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Is Ozempic covered by insurance in Jamaica?</summary>
                        <p>Coverage varies significantly by insurance provider and plan. <strong>For type 2 diabetes:</strong> Ozempic is FDA-approved and more likely to be covered (often with prior authorization). <strong>For weight loss:</strong> Ozempic is prescribed off-label and less likely to be covered, though some plans cover it for patients with BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with weight-related conditions. Wegovy (same medication, different branding) is FDA-approved for weight loss but often not covered. Our Kingston team can provide documentation, diagnosis codes, and letters of medical necessity to support insurance claims when applicable.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item fade-in-element">
                        <summary>Can I drink alcohol while on Ozempic?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable</strong>, but there are important considerations: Alcohol may increase risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), especially if you have diabetes; alcohol can worsen gastrointestinal side effects like nausea; alcohol is calorie-dense and may slow weight loss progress. We recommend limiting alcohol intake, especially during the first 4-8 weeks when side effects are most common. If you do drink, stay hydrated and eat food with alcohol. Discuss your specific situation with our medical team, particularly if you have diabetes.</p>

                        <summary>What's the difference between Ozempic and Mounjaro (tirzepatide)?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Ozempic (semaglutide):</strong> GLP-1 receptor agonist; average 12-15% weight loss; once weekly injection; well-studied safety profile. <strong>Mounjaro (tirzepatide):</strong> Dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist; average 15-20% weight loss (slightly more effective); once weekly injection; may have more nausea initially. Both are excellent options. Mounjaro often produces more weight loss but may cost more and have more side effects. We'll help determine which medication is best for you based on your medical history, weight loss goals, tolerance, and budget during your Kingston consultation.</p>

                        <summary>Will I need to follow a special diet on Ozempic?</summary>
                        <p>There's no specific "Ozempic diet," but we recommend evidence-based nutrition strategies: <strong>High protein</strong> (25-30% of calories) to preserve muscle during weight loss and increase satiety; <strong>Nutrient-dense foods</strong> (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins); <strong>Adequate hydration</strong> (8+ glasses water daily); <strong>Smaller, more frequent meals</strong> (4-6 per day) to manage reduced stomach capacity and nausea; <strong>Avoid greasy, fatty, or fried foods</strong> that worsen GI side effects. Our dietitian provides personalized meal planning guidance for optimal results and symptom management.</p>

                        <summary>Can men use Ozempic for weight loss?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely! Ozempic is highly effective for both men and women struggling with weight management. The medication works the same regardless of gender—it reduces appetite, slows stomach emptying, and improves metabolic function. Clinical trials included both sexes with similar efficacy. We treat many male patients at our Kingston clinic, including men with obesity, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or weight-related health conditions. Men often see excellent results, particularly when combined with strength training to preserve muscle mass.</p>

                        <p><strong>If missed by ≤5 days:</strong> Take your dose as soon as you remember, then resume your regular weekly schedule. <strong>If missed by >5 days:</strong> Skip that dose entirely and take your next dose on your regularly scheduled day. <strong>Never double-dose:</strong> Do not take two doses within 48 hours of each other, as this significantly increases risk of severe nausea and vomiting. If you frequently miss doses or need to adjust your injection day, contact our Kingston team for guidance.</p>

                        <p>"Ozempic face" refers to facial volume loss and sagging that can occur with rapid, significant weight loss—not unique to Ozempic but common with any major weight loss. <strong>To minimize:</strong> Lose weight gradually (1-2 lbs/week maximum), consume adequate protein (1g per pound of ideal body weight), incorporate strength training to preserve muscle mass, stay hydrated, and maintain good skincare. If facial volume loss is concerning, dermal fillers can restore volume. Muscle loss is preventable with adequate protein intake and resistance exercise—essential components of our comprehensive program.</p>

                        <summary>Can I take Ozempic if I don't have diabetes?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! While Ozempic is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes, it's commonly prescribed <strong>off-label for weight loss</strong> in patients without diabetes who have BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with weight-related conditions (hypertension, sleep apnea, high cholesterol). Off-label prescribing is legal, common, and appropriate when medically indicated. Wegovy (same medication, different brand/dose) is FDA-approved specifically for weight loss but often harder to obtain and not covered by insurance. During your Kingston consultation, we'll determine if Ozempic is medically appropriate for your situation.</p>

                        <summary>What are the serious risks or contraindications for Ozempic?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Contraindications (do not use if you have):</strong> Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2); history of severe pancreatitis; pregnancy or breastfeeding. <strong>Serious but rare risks:</strong> Pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas), gallbladder problems, kidney injury (from dehydration), severe allergic reactions, increased heart rate. <strong>Screening required:</strong> We carefully screen all patients during consultation, review medical history, and monitor throughout treatment to minimize risks. Most patients tolerate Ozempic well with proper medical supervision.</p>
