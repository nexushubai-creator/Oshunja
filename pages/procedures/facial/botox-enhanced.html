Botox is the #1 most popular cosmetic treatment worldwide for reducing wrinkles and fine lines.</p>

                        <p>Botox works by temporarily relaxing the facial muscles that cause dynamic wrinkles - those lines that appear when you smile, frown, or squint. Our precision injection technique ensures natural-looking results that enhance your features while maintaining your ability to express emotion.</p>

                        <p>Whether you're looking to smooth forehead lines, reduce crow's feet around the eyes, or soften frown lines between your brows, our experienced team will create a customized treatment plan tailored to your unique facial structure and aesthetic goals.</p>

                <div class="faq-luxury">
                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>How long does Botox last?</summary>
                        <p>Botox typically lasts 3-4 months. With regular treatments, some patients find their results last longer as muscles become trained to relax. We recommend scheduling maintenance treatments every 3-4 months for optimal results.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>Does Botox hurt?</summary>
                        <p>Most patients describe the sensation as a quick pinch or slight stinging. We use ultra-fine needles to minimize discomfort. Ice or numbing cream can be applied if you're particularly sensitive, though most patients don't require it.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>Will I look frozen or unnatural?</summary>
                        <p>Not when administered by our experienced physicians. We use precise dosing and strategic placement to smooth wrinkles while maintaining natural facial expressions. You'll look like yourself - just refreshed and rejuvenated.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>What's the difference between Botox and fillers?</summary>
                        <p>Botox relaxes muscles to smooth dynamic wrinkles caused by facial expressions. Fillers (like Juvederm) add volume to restore lost fullness and smooth static wrinkles. Often, they're used together for comprehensive facial rejuvenation.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>How much does Botox cost in Kingston, Jamaica?</summary>
                        <p>Botox pricing varies based on the number of treatment areas and units required. During your complimentary consultation, we'll provide a detailed quote tailored to your needs. We offer flexible payment plans to make treatment accessible.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>When will I see results?</summary>
                        <p>You'll begin to notice results in 3-5 days as the Botox takes effect. Full results are visible at 2 weeks. We schedule a complimentary follow-up at this time to ensure you're completely satisfied with your results.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>Is Botox safe for darker skin tones?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely. Botox works on muscles, not skin pigmentation, making it safe and effective for all skin tones including melanin-rich Caribbean skin. Our physicians have extensive experience treating diverse patients in Kingston.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>Can I get Botox if I'm planning pregnancy?</summary>
                        <p>We do not recommend Botox during pregnancy or breastfeeding as a precaution, though studies haven't shown adverse effects. If you're planning to become pregnant, discuss timing with your physician.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>What age should I start Botox?</summary>
                        <p>Many patients start "preventative Botox" in their mid-to-late 20s or early 30s to prevent deep wrinkles from forming. Others wait until lines are more visible. The ideal age depends on your skin, genetics, and personal goals.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-luxury">
                        <summary>Can Botox treat excessive sweating?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! Botox is FDA-approved to treat hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) in the underarms, hands, and feet. If you struggle with excessive perspiration, ask about this treatment during your consultation.</p>
